With this project I wanted to use supervised learning and an ensemble model as well to predict how many calories can be burnt

In this dataset it consists of 9 columns on top of 15000 rows. The columns consist of -
UserID
Gender 
Age
Height(cm)
Weight(kg)
Duration(min)
Heart rate 
Body temperature(c)

Models and evaluation - The two models I used for this were multiple linear regression as well as random forests for my ensemble model. For my evaluation metrics I used R-squared scores and mean square error
